# Task List Rails

We are going to build the task list using our new rails knowledge. This project will enable us to keep track of and persist, add, edit and remove tasks.

## Baseline
Once you've achieved this baseline, take a walk around the room and see if you can answer questions or help other teams.

This project...

- requires you to create a Rails application
  - create the necessary migrations
  - create the model for TaskList
  
<!--
## Wave 1
This wave is where we will introduce the layer where we begin interacting with our application via the browser.

  - Use the provided seed data to create a script that will pre-populate your database with a given set of tasks
  - Set up necessary controllers and routes that you will need in order to support the requirement for creating a new task
  - Add some styles and fancifying to your app

## Wave 2
In this wave we will add user interactivity and persistence
  - Add the task list breakfast functionality

## Wave 3
  - Add the task list lunch and dinner functionality

## Wave 4
  - Introduce the concept of people into your task list
    - Any given person can have one to many tasks
    - Update your seed data to assign tasks pseudo-randomly to a few different people
    - When a task is created, allow the user to specify which person it is assigned to
