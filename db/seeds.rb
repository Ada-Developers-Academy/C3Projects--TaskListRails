# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# tasks = [
#   {name: "Bobbi", description: "Laundry", date: "06/17/2015"},
#   {name: "Tami", description: "Dishes"},
#   {name: "Joaquin", description: "Dusting"},
#   {name: "Phoenix", description: "Polishing"},
#   {name: "Xavier", description: "Groceries"},

# tasks.each do |task|
#   Task.create(task)
